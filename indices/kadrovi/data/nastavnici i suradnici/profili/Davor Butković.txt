    Biography
        Davor Butković was born in 1935 in Split, where he completed his secondary school education in 1953. In 1960 and in 1967, he obtained a BSc degree in Electrical Engineering from the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and a BSc degree in Pure Mathematics from the Faculty of Science, University of Zagreb. In 1962, he started to work in the Institute of Applied Mathematics at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, where he worked until 2000. He received his MSc degree and PhD degree from the Faculty of Science, University of Zagreb, in 1973 and in 1975, respectively. Dr Butković was appointed assistant professor, associate professor and full professor in 1975, 1981, and 1987, respectively. In 1998, he was appointed full professor with tenure. From 2000 to 2002 he worked as Assistant Minister for International Cooperation at the Ministry of Science and Technology, and from 2003 until his retirement in 2006 he was employed at the Department of Mathematics, University of Osijek.
        Dr Butković taught courses at undergraduate and postgraduate studies at the Faculty of Science and the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in Zagreb, and universities of Split, Osijek and Tuzla. In the 1983-84 academic year, he was a visiting professor at the University of Florida. He also paid longer and shorter study visits to Rennes, Warsaw, Perugia, Kiev and Graz. Dr Butković has authored or co-authored about twenty scientific papers in the field of measure theory, summability theory and probability theory. He has published two books at the University of Osijek, parts of which and first editions were published as course materials. Dr Butković was awarded the 1995 Josip Lončar gold medal by the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in Zagreb, and in 2002 he was awarded the Ordre des Palmes Académiques by the French Republic pour services rendus a la culture française.
        Professor Davor Butković passed away on 2020.
